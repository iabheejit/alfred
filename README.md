## Overview
This project presents three innovative solutions for course delivery using AI-powered models and WhatsApp integration. The solutions are designed to provide learning opportunities in both online and offline environments. 

## Features

### 1. Standard Course
A structured course delivery system via WhatsApp flows that simulates a classroom environment.

- **Classroom Simulation**: Courses are based on AI-generated reference materials.
- **Q&A with Vision Capabilities**: Students can ask questions and receive visual support from the AI.

### 2. WhatsApp AI Personalized Course
A personalized learning system powered by AI with extensive course flexibility.
- **AI-Generated Courses**: Backed by **Meta 3.2** with a **90B Vision Instruct** model, learners can study any topic.

### 3. Edge Llama Access
An offline-ready model that allows course access and learning without the need for constant internet connectivity.

- **Run with/without Internet**: Utilizes **TuneAI** with **Meta 3.2 90B Vision Instruct** for online use, and **Llama 3.2 1B Instruct** for local model inference when offline.
